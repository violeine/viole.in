import Quine from '@/components/quine.astro'

## a component that print itself

<Quine path="pages/sink/quine.mdx"  />

pretty neat for writing blogs, docs that need both source code and 
component available.

like this `Quine` component <Quine path="components/quine.astro"/>

and `Quine` can also take an `optional range` for more specific
explaination

I use `node:fs` to fetch the file and print it in `Shiki` code block
<Quine path="components/quine.astro" line="7-14" lang="js"/>
